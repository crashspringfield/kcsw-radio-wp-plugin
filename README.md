# KCSW Feed Player Widget
A [Worpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kscw-feed-player/) that creates a radio station based of multiple RSS feeds. 

I track this in Git because its 2019. Version control in Wordpress sucks. This will always be the most up-to-date.

## Development
* `npm run build:js` - minifies JavaScript
* `npm run build:css` - minifies CSS

## Contributing
If there's a feature or bug, open an issue. I'll get to it when I can or feel free to fork and implement it yourself.

## License
GPLv2 or later
